RobotVoiceControl
=================

Sample Glass Application to demonstrate robot voice control.

This app allows the user to send voice commands to a ROS system using a websocket connection and (rosbridge)[rosbrige.org].
This application also relies on the voice_command.py from the (ros_glass_tools package)[https://github.com/aktaylor08/ros_glass_tools].

Can send defined commands to all robots or single robots using customized ROS launch files. 


To run on glass enable developer mode, edit the socket address in the source file to the correct location and load 
on the glass.

See documentation on the  ROS wiki and other projects for further setup instructions.
